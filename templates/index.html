    <h1 style="text-align:center;">Crime in PG County is Decreasing</h1>

<p style="max-width: 800px; margin: auto;">
    Prince George's County is known to be one of the most affluent majority Black counties in the U.S. 
    Despite this, PG County has a reputation of not being a very safe area. 
    It is undoubtedly true that, with the exception of Baltimore City, PG County has more crime than any other county in Maryland. 
    That being said, there is good news — crime is decreasing!
</p>


   <h2>Month in Crime: By the Numbers</h2>
<canvas id="monthlyCrimeChart"></canvas>

<p style="max-width: 800px; margin: auto;">
    The chart above tracks the total number of reported crimes over time. 
    As you can see, while the data fluctuates up and down a bit, the overall trend in PG County is downward. 
    This suggests progress is being made in reducing crime, even if not every month looks the same.

   <h2>From Theft to Violent Crime: PG’s Offense Breakdown</h2>
<canvas id="crimeTypeChart"></canvas>

<p style="max-width: 800px; margin: auto;">
    Here, we can see that the two most common crimes in PG County are "Accidents," as in traffic accidents. 
    This includes incidents like fleeing from the scene of a crash.
    While still serious, it’s worth noting that the most common crimes in PG County are not always intentional or violent. 
    The other crimes in the top five are also trending down, which is a positive sign for public safety.
</p>


   <h2>Which Sector Has the Most Time on Their Hands?</h2>
<canvas id="sectorScatterChart"></canvas>

<p style="max-width: 800px; margin: auto;">
    Finally, the last chart shows the areas where police have the most time on their hands dealing with crime. 
    PG County, just like most large counties in the U.S., has cities where more crime is committed than others. 
    By looking at crime trends by sector, residents can see where incidents are happening most frequently and over which years. 
    Some sectors consistently show higher crime activity, which may reflect higher population density, more commercial areas, or historical underinvestment in public resources. These insights can help local leaders allocate law enforcement resources more effectively, prioritize safety initiatives, and direct funding to communities that need it most. It also gives residents a clearer sense of how crime impacts different parts of the county and reinforces the need for neighborhood-level strategies to reduce crime and increase community safety.
